# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a Python terminal game for some quick fun.
It runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The user plays against the Computer taking turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## Testing 

### Manual testing
I manually tested this site in multiple ways highlighted below:
* Passed the code through a PEP8 linter with no errors present.
* Tested the code in [Replit](https://replit.com/~) through the Console output.
* Tested invalid inputs to confirm that the code worked properly with errors.
* Deployed the project in Heroku at an early stage and received feedback from a professional developer (mentor), as well as multiple Python-proficient friends.

### Validator Testing 
- PEP8
  - There were no errors present when passing through the PEP8 testor ![PEP8](docs/screenshots/)

### Cloning

I used the cloning method to use the VSCode desktop IDE with GitHub, below are the steps I took:
- Generate a repository and click the Code button in the middle of the screen.
- Go to Local and under Clone, copy the Git repository URL on the HTTPS tab.
- Go to the VSCode IDE front page and click 'Clone Git Repository' under Start or go to the Source Control button on the left-hand side menu bar and click 'Clone Repository'.
- Input the URL in the URL tab at the top of the window and press Enter.
- Select the location/folder where you want to store your repository on your computer through the popup and click the 'Select Repository location' button.
- VSCode will now clone the repository and you can choose to open it in your current window or in a new window.

## Credits 

- I drew help from various YouTube videos and Python works, all listed below:

There can be similarities in the code but I changed it as much as possible for the purpose of my project.

- W3Schools and StackOverflow were the sites mostly used for external references.
